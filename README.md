# iAMPCN: a deep-learning approach for identifying antimicrobial peptides and their functional activities
## Introduction
Due to the microbial pathogens’ increasing resistance to chemical antibiotics, it is urgent to develop novel infectious therapeutics. 
Over the past decade, there have been several developments in utilizing antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) as potential alternatives to treat 
infections since most natural AMPs are particular polypeptide substances in living organisms and are critical components of the innate 
immune system which protects the host against invading pathogens. AMPs are generally small-molecule polypeptides and have diverse functional 
activities against target organisms such as bacteria, yeasts, fungi, viruses, and cancer cells. Compared with traditional chemical 
antibiotics, AMPs have higher antibacterial activities, broader antibacterial spectrums, and fewer possibilities resulting in target strains’ 
resistance mutation. Therefore, AMPs have a wide range of application prospects in the pharmaceutical industry and have become a hotspot 
of biomedical research.
